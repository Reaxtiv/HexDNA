# HEXDNA
HexDNA is building a new kind of digital identity system that merges Web2 and Web3 identities into a verifiable, visual, and portable profile.

Key innovations include:

Social Identity Aggregation: Link Twitter, YouTube, Farcaster, and more into a unified, persistent profile.

.dna Name System: Human-readable, transferable names tied to reputation and social identity (like "alice.dna").

Glyph Visual Layer: Each user identity is represented by a procedurally-generated glyph (visual avatar), based on their activity, networks, and online presence.

Name Marketplace: A native .dna marketplace where users can buy, sell, or collect identities — turning usernames into assets.

No current solution on web3 offers this combination of social reputation, human-readable names, visual expression, and identity-based marketplace. HexDNA introduces a novel stack for self-expression, reputation, and ownership.

It opens up new possibilities for:

Wallet integrations (a visual profile tied to an address).

Identity and credential layers for DAOs and dApps.

Gamification and social UX for onboarding.

A new class of digital collectibles based on names and identity
